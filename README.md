In 2023, Cometeer collaborated with YouTube coffee expert James Hoffmann for The Great American Coffee Taste Test. 5,000 pre-extracted and flash-frozen coffee kits were shipped nationwide, containing four varieties. Participants, guided by James in a YouTube livestream on October 21st, 2023, conducted blind tastings and ratings. Demographic and coffee-related questions were included to analyze results.

Note: The total number of participants in this survey is 4042, with around 50% of them aged between 25-34. Most participants consume 2 cups of coffee, regardless of age. 70% of the participants are White/Caucasian, & the predominant group comprises both males and females, with a ratio of 3:1, highlighting males as the majority.

# Recommendation
1. Create and market premium home coffee products to target home coffee drinkers. Innovate with user-friendly brewing equipment and accessories for an enhanced at-home coffee experience.
2. For specialty coffee shops and local cafe lovers, showcase your specialty blends, featuring unique flavors and high-quality beans guaranteed to delight coffee enthusiasts. Create an inviting atmosphere with cozy seating and ambient lighting to enhance their experience.
3. Focus on determining the favorite coffee among different age groups to understand market preferences for each age group and identify the most popular coffee choices.
4. In the blind test, 36.7% of participants preferred Coffee D, indicating a preference for light roast coffee with natural processing methods. This type of coffee is characterized by fermented notes and funky/fruity flavors, with most participants noting high acidity and low bitterness. As 36.7% of them liked it, invest in developing a line of light roast coffees with natural processing methods similar to Coffee D, focusing on highlighting fermented notes and funky/fruity flavors.
5. The market has two main segments based on spending: Moderate spenders ($20-$40 monthly) prioritize affordability and variety. Target them with mid-priced coffees emphasizing value. Higher spenders ($40-$60 monthly) value quality and uniqueness. Offer them specialty coffees with a focus on taste profiles and origin stories.
6. 25% of participants are willing to spend $8-$10 on a cup of coffee, indicating a segment willing to pay premium prices for quality or specialty coffee. This segment could be targeted with premium offerings, specialty blends, artisanal brewing methods, and upscale ambiance in coffee shops.
